# About Me
## Who am I and what is this place?

Am a Computer Science major with immense interest in my discipline and this place is a reflection of a nerdier side of me.

I am a student, gentleman, part time researcher, ethical hacker, foodie, gamer and an addict of machines. I love spending most of my time on my computer learning more about the tech and tools i use and exploring different things.

## The answers to the questions people ask me about.

* No, I wonâ€™t fix your pc. I spend my days fixing and addressing computers and learning more about the tools and techs I use.  I like to do other things when I am off college.
* I love to do deep talks about topics like the universe, physics, the technologies involved in computer functioning and other technical topics.
* I love to explore and learn more about the inner workings of any tech and so most of my time goes in setting up sandboxes to study that particular tech.
* Some of my time goes in investing and grooming myself.
* Currently I do not hold any IT related certifications but am planning to get some.
